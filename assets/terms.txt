12. TERM AND TERMINATION.

12.1 TERM. The Terms commence on the date when you accept them (as described in the preamble above) and remain in full force and effect while you use the Ember Properties, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the Terms.

12.2 TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF SERVICES BY EMBER. If you have materially breached any provision of the Terms, or if Ember is required to do so by law (e.g., where the provision of the Website, the Application, or the Services is, or becomes, unlawful), Ember has the right to immediately suspend any Services and licenses provided to you under this Agreement (“SUSPENSION”). Following Suspension, Ember and your applicable Entity will work in good faith to determine whether to reinstate your access to (and any associated licenses to) the Services or permanently terminate your Services, such determination to be made by your Entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Ember may terminate your account in its sole discretion in the event that (a) you are a repeat infringer for purposes of Ember’s copyright infringement policy as described in Section 11 or (b) you violate a restriction in Section 1.2 and, after Ember makes reasonable efforts to provide you with notice of such violation, you violate Section 1.2 a subsequent time. You agree that Ember shall not be liable to you for any Suspensions or terminations made in accordance with the Terms. Termination or Suspension of any Service may include removal of access to such Service and barring of further use of the Service. Termination (but not Suspension) of all Services also may include deletion of your password and all related information, files and Content associated with or inside your Account (or any part thereof), including Your Content. Upon termination of any Service for all customers, or in the event that Ember’s agreement with your Entity or with a facilitator that has an agreement with Ember and with your Entity, terminates (unless Ember at approximately the same time enters into a new agreement with your Entity), your right to use such Service will automatically terminate immediately. Ember will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any Suspension or termination, including for deletion of Your Content. All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive, shall survive termination of Services, including without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitation of liability.

13. GENERAL PROVISIONS.

13.1 ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS. The communications between you and Ember use electronic means, whether you visit the Ember Properties or send Ember e-mails, or whether Ember posts notices on the Ember Properties or communicates with you via e-mail. For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from Ember in an electronic form; and (2) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Ember provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were to be in writing. The foregoing does not affect your statutory rights.

13.2 RELEASE. You hereby release Ember Parties and their successors from claims, demands, any and all losses, damages, rights, and actions of any kind, including personal injuries, death, and property damage, that is either directly or indirectly related to or arises from any interactions with or conduct of other Website Users or third-party websites of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of the Terms or your use of the Ember Properties. If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.

13.3 ASSIGNMENT. The Terms, and your rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Ember’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. Ember may assign this Agreement without your consent.

13.4 FORCE MAJEURE. Ember shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.

13.5 COMPLIANCE. If you believe that Ember has not adhered to the Terms, please contact Ember by emailing us at legal@ember.com. We will do our best to address your concerns. If you feel that your complaint has been addressed incompletely, we invite you to let us know for further investigation.

13.6 NOTICE. Where Ember requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are responsible for providing Ember with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address you provided to Ember is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required/ permitted by the Terms, Ember’s dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice. You may give notice to Ember at the following address: 6330 South 3000 East, Suite 700, Salt Lake City, UT 84121. Such notice shall be deemed given when received by Ember by letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first class postage prepaid mail at the above address.

13.7 WAIVER. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of the Terms on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.

13.8 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of the Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of the Terms will remain enforceable, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.

13.9 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. The Terms are the final, complete and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and merges all prior discussions between the parties with respect to such subject matter.
